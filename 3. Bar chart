Bar Chart
1. When to use it

To compare values across different categories clearly.

Great for showing differences or rankings between items.

Useful when category labels are long or when you have many categories.

2. How to use it — step-by-step

Open Power BI Desktop and load your data.

In the Report view, click the Bar chart icon in the Visualizations pane.

Drag a categorical field (e.g., “Product Category”) into the Axis area.

Drag a numerical field (e.g., “Sales Amount”) into the Values area.

(Optional) Drag a field into Legend to show subcategories within bars.

Customize the chart appearance in the Format pane if needed.

3. Example

Compare total sales for different product categories:

Axis: Product Category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing)

Values: Sales Amount

Show count of customers by city:

Axis: City

Values: Number of Customers

Tip / Pitfall

Avoid adding too many categories; too many bars make the chart cluttered and hard to read. Use filters or slicers to narrow down data.
